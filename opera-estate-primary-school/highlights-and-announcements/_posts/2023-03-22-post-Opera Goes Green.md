<p>Our school&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme, the Opera Goes Green (OPG), focuses on Sustainability. The three prongs of OPG can be encapsulated in 3 As - Awareness, Action, Advocacy. Hence the aims of OPG are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create&nbsp;<strong>awareness</strong>&nbsp;of environmental sustainability issues</li>
<li>Motivate students in taking environmentally-conscious&nbsp;<strong>actions</strong></li>
<li>Empower students to&nbsp;<strong>advocate</strong>&nbsp;for environmental causes</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Sustainability Education</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The OPG provides a broad-based Sustainability education on which allow students to keep abreast with the latest sustainability issues that are affecting us. This includes school talks helmed by Green Champions (leadership arm of OPG) on issues like food waste and conservation of biodiversity. Students also participate in activities during commemorative events such as World Water Day and Green Week.</li>
