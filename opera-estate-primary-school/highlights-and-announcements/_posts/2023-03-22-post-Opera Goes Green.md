<p>Our school&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme, the Opera Goes Green (OPG), focuses on Sustainability. The three prongs of OPG can be encapsulated in 3 As - Awareness, Action, Advocacy. Hence the aims of OPG are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create&nbsp;<strong>awareness</strong>&nbsp;of environmental sustainability issues</li>
<li>Motivate students in taking environmentally-conscious&nbsp;<strong>actions</strong></li>
<li>Empower students to&nbsp;<strong>advocate</strong>&nbsp;for environmental causes</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Sustainability Education</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The OPG provides a broad-based Sustainability education on which allow students to keep abreast with the latest sustainability issues that are affecting us. This includes school talks helmed by Green Champions (leadership arm of OPG) on issues like food waste and conservation of biodiversity. Students also participate in activities during commemorative events such as World Water Day and Green Week.</li>

<h4><strong>Digital Maker Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In line with Smart Nation and a need to inculcate entrepreneurial dare and lifelong learning, the P4 and P5 levels go through a Digital Maker Programme which integrates STEM with Sustainability education. Students learn coding and computational thinking using a micro:bit. They then go through a Design Thinking process to create prototypes using recycled materials to tackle real-life environmental problems. These experiences nurture creativity and builds a culture of innovation and resilience among students.</p>
