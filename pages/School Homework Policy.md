<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>In Opera Estate Primary School, we believe in the value of homework to help our pupils consolidate their knowledge and skills and cultivate lifelong habits of independent and self-directed learning. The main aim of this policy is to outline some guiding principles and measures to ensure the effective use of homework as complementary learning activities.</p>
<h4>Value of Homework</h4>
<p>Homework enables pupils to practise the skills taught and process the information learnt, resulting in better understanding and retention of learning. Through homework assignments, pupils have the opportunity to learn outside the classroom and nurture greater self-discipline, time management and a sense of independence. In the process, pupils cultivate good study habits and positive work ethics.</p>
<h4>Types of Homework</h4>
<p>Homework is any learning activity that pupils are required to complete outside school curriculum hours. When used appropriately, it can improve pupil&rsquo;s academic ability, study skills and disposition towards learning. However, when inappropriately or excessively used, homework can impact negatively on pupils&rsquo; achievements and motivation.</p>
<h4>Role of Parents</h4>
<p>Parents play an important part in the children&rsquo;s education. Parents can consider doing the following to support their children in their learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your child&rsquo;s Pupil&rsquo;s Handbook daily to view the homework assignments for the day.</li>
<li>Spend time to go through your child&rsquo;s school work.</li>
<li>Spend time to supervise your child in doing the homework assignments and learning through the homework assignments.</li>
<li>Remind your child to complete the school homework before doing tuition work (if any).</li>
<li>Allow your child to complete his/her work independently, where possible.</li>
<li>Guide your child to set aside a regular study time and establish good study habits.</li>
<li>Provide a well-lit, comfortable and quiet spot in your home and designate it as homework area.</li>
<li>Ensure your child&rsquo;s timely completion and punctual submission of homework assignments all the time, so that there will not be a backlog.</li>
<li>Consult teachers on your child&rsquo;s progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>We seek the understanding, support and collaboration of parents as our partners in education to ensure that homework is seen as an important component in the learning-teaching process.</p>
<h4>Role of Pupils</h4>
<p>In order to attain the full benefits from the value of homework, pupils should do the following on a daily basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom for the homework assignments.</li>
<li>Record the homework assignments in the Pupil&rsquo;s Handbook.</li>
<li>Make sure that they understand what needs to be done for all the given homework assignments.</li>
<li>Seek help from teachers if they face any difficulty.</li>
<li>Organize their textbooks, workbooks, worksheets and files systematically.</li>
<li>Ensure that the homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.</li>
<li>Hove a study timetable at home.</li>
<li>Have a neat study area at home, which is away from distractions such as the television and the computer.</li>
<li>Submit completed homework assignments punctually to teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Guidelines on Daily Homework</h4>
<p>The school seeks to ensure pupils&rsquo; wellness by not overloading pupils with homework assignments. It has worked out an estimated amount of time that pupils would spend to complete their homework assignments on a typical school day. This is just an estimate and some pupils may require less or more time, depending on individual learning needs and styles.</p>

<h4>Guidelines on Holiday Homework Assignments</h4>
<p>During the school holidays and the PSLE Marking Exercise, homework assignments may be issued. The school has worked out an estimated amount of time that pupils would spend on various subjects/programmes during each period.</p>
