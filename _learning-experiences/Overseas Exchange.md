<h4>CULTURAL IMMERSION PROGRAMME TO KRABI</h4>
<p>In 2019, our P5 students went for a Cultural Immersion Trip to Krabi to learn more about our&nbsp;neighbouring countries. It gave them an opportunity to experience what schools are like in other&nbsp;countries as well as learn more about their cultures. The experience gave them a strong sense of&nbsp;rootedness and cultivated in them the OPERA learning dispositions (<strong>Open-mindedness. Perseverance.&nbsp;Engagement. Resourcefulness. Awareness</strong>).</p>

<p>Ever since COVID19 hit us in 2020, the school had to leverage on technology and ICT to continue to provide opportunities for our&nbsp;students to learn about our South East Asian neighbours. Teachers planned and designed online SLS lesson packages for students to learn more about Thailand's culture, geography, people and the Arts.</p>
