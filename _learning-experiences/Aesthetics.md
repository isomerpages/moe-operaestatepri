<h4><b>Music</b></h4>
<p style="font-size:16px" align="justify">Through the Music curriculum, students will be introduced to a wide range of genres and  styles to put them in touch with their heritage as well as deepen their understanding of the  cultural diversity of music in Singapore and the world. In addition, the Music curriculum can  contribute to the holistic development of our students by developing 21st Century  Competencies (21CC), values, character and social-emotional well-being. It also contributes  towards extra-musical skills including psychomotor skills. The Music curriculum also lays the  foundation for further educational opportunities in music and endeavours to foster a lifelong  interest and involvement in music which would enable our students to appreciate and  contribute to Singapore’s cultural tapestry. </p>

	<li>Acquire and apply musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening,  Creating and Performing<br></li>  
	<li>Develop abilities for creative expression and communication<br></li>
	<li>Develop an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures<br></li>

<h4><b>Art</b></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to:<br><br><b>- enjoy art,<br>- communicate visually, and<br>- make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</b><br><br>Guided by the aims, the school art curriculum across all levels provides our students with a
balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It
presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It
also contributes to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The learning
of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity
by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions
(primary) and discourse/critique (secondary) in the curriculum promotes a lifelong enjoyment
for and an appreciation of artistic works, developing visual literacy in our students. The
production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to
innovate and improvise.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">The objectives of the primary art syllabus are to develop all students as active artists and informed audience with:<br><br>- visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surroundings,<br><br>- curiosity, imagination and enjoyment in art making and art discussion,<br><br>- confidence in working individually and in groups to focus ideas and create artworks, and<br><br>- awareness of and respect for histories and cultures of key artworks and artists in Singapore and the world.

<p>The objectives of the syllabus are achieved through the Primary Art Syllabus Framework below that encapsulates the key features of the syllabus:    </p>
