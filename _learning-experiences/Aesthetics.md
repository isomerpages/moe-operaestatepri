<h4><b>Music</b></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">Our music education philosophy embraces the belief that all children are musical and seeks to develop their aural and expressive abilities and sensibilities to empower them to appreciate and participate in music. This is in alignment with the Singapore Curriculum Philosophy that every child wants to and can learn. The Primary Music syllabus is developed on the premise that every child possesses innate musical qualities that could be harnessed and developed. Students will have the opportunities to explore their environment through sounds and develop a connection with music through experiences that are meaningful and valuable. These include the ability to listen, sing, play, create and express themselves musically. </p>

<h4><b>Art</b></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. Guided by the aims, the school art curriculum across all levels provides our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It also contributes to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. The engagement in art discussions (primary) and discourse/critique (secondary) in the curriculum promotes a lifelong enjoyment for and an appreciation of artistic works, developing visual literacy in our students. The production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">The objectives of the syllabus are achieved through the Primary Art Syllabus Framework below that encapsulates the key features of the syllabus:</p>
