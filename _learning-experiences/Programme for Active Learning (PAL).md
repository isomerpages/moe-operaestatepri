<p>In Opera Estate Primary School, all P1 and P2 students undergo Programme for Active Learning (PAL) during curriculum hours. During PAL, students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences that facilitate their holistic development in the physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision-making. The PAL modules aim for students to develop confidence in what they do, develop a sense of curiosity and positive attitude towards learning and enjoy group experiences and teamwork.</p>
