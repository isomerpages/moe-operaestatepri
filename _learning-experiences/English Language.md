<h4><strong>CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">From 2020, a new English Language Syllabus has been introduced, starting from Primary One. The EL Syllabus 2020 focuses on the skills needed for the 21st Century, developing students as critical inquirers, discerning readers and empathetic communicators. The curriculum framework is shown below:

</p><h4><strong>EXPERIENCES</strong></h4>
<p align="justify"><u><b>P1 and P2 Learning Experiences</b></u>
<br>In line with our Curriculum Framework, the students engage in learning opportunities to discover their strengths, interests and improve in their areas of weaknesses. Students learn and use the EL skills to share their passion and personal experiences through activities such as the OPERAXpress, Reader’s Theatre and learning journeys.

</p><p align="justify"><b><u>What’s Up<br></u></b>To help enhance the students’ awareness of global issues and current affairs, Primary 4 to 6 students receive a copy of the “What’s Up” Student newspaper every month. Teachers use the “What’s Up” newspaper in class to generate class discussions and get students to reflect on and think critically about global issues. Students can write in to the What’s Up publishers to share their views and perspectives on the issues reported and good letters will get published. Several of our students’ responses have been published over the past few years.<br><br>OEPS is proud to have a number of our students be featured in the What’s Up newspaper publication. As part of our English department program, Primary 4 to 6 students are encouraged to respond to articles in the publication. Students learn to be discerning readers by staying well informed and evaluate the information in the newspaper with a critical eye. Students are also exposed to current affairs around the world, widening their knowledge as global citizens.

<p align="justify"><b><u>Newsmaker</u></b><br>
The Primary 5 and 6 students have learned to produce news videos using the NewsMaker program, creating content to explore issues that are close to their hearts. The Upper Primary students have also attended a masterclass conducted by a ChannelNewsAsia journalist to learn how to be more effective communicators.</p>

<p align="justify"><b><u>Language Week</u></b><br>
During Language Week, students discovered the joy of reading through a variety of language activities. From dramas to poetry recitations to media reports, students used the language when presenting their information. They also participated actively in engaging English Language-themed recess activities such as Bingo or Snakes and Ladders.<br><br>
The annual book Character day in Language Week was made extra special this year with the visit of Minister Chan. Check out his IG to find out what he thought about it.</p>
