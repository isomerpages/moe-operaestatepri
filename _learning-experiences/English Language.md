<h4><strong>CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK</strong></h4>
<h4>From 2020, a new English Language Syllabus has been introduced, starting from Primary One. The EL Syllabus 2020 focuses on the skills needed for the 21st Century, developing students as critical inquirers, discerning readers and empathetic communicators. The curriculum framework is shown below:</h4>

<h4><strong>EXPERIENCES</strong></h4>
<h4><u>P1 and P2 Learning Experiences</u></h4>

<p>In line with our Curriculum Framework, the lower primary students engage in learning opportunities to discover their strengths, interests and improve in their areas of weaknesses. Students share their passion and personal experiences through activities such as the OPERAXpress and Show and Tell.</p>
<p>Despite the recent SMM, students continue to engage in learning journeys through in-school movie screenings, Zoom learning journeys and online collaboration with their peers. From dressing up as the animal characters in Walking Through The Jungle to observing the fascinating transformation of a butterfly from a caterpillar to a beautiful winged adult before releasing it to the wild for A Butterfly is Born, students learn to read, write, listen and speak about the different STELLAR titles they enjoy in the classes.</p>
<p><strong><u>What&rsquo;s Up<br /></u></strong>To help enhance the students&rsquo; awareness of global issues and current affairs, Primary 5 and 6 students receive a copy of the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up&rdquo; Student newspaper every month. Teachers use the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up&rdquo; newspaper in class to generate class discussions and get students to reflect on and think critically about global issues. Students can write in to the What&rsquo;s Up publishers to share their views and perspectives on the issues reported and good letters will get published. Several of our students&rsquo; responses have been published over the past few years.</p>

<p><strong>SUPPORT PROGRAMMES</strong></p>
<p><u>Learning Support Programme (LSP)&nbsp;</u><strong>(P1-P2)<br /></strong>A specialised early intervention programme aimed at providing learning support to pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills. Pupils are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is to equip pupils with basic literacy skills so that they could access learning in the regular classroom.</p>
<p><u>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR) </u><strong>(P3-P4)<br /></strong>A two-year intervention for Primary 3 and 4 students who are identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. The curriculum has been designed taking into consideration the students&rsquo; learning profile and the contents of the mainstream English language curriculum.</p>
<p><u>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) </u><strong>(P3-P4)<br /></strong>An intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students who did not meet the discharge criteria for LSP and who do not have dyslexia at the end of Primary 2 LSP. The RRP focuses on improving (i) word recognition and spelling, (ii) fluency, (iii) vocabulary and (iv) reading comprehension in the students.</p>
<p><strong>EXTENSION PROGRAMMES</strong></p>
<p><u>English Enrichment<br /></u>The EL Enrichment is an extension programme targeting mainly Primary 4 and 5 students who display strong language skills and positive disposition towards learning. The programme involves weekly training sessions where students will develop 21st Century Competencies like research skills, critical thinking and creative thinking skills through communication skills in oracy and writing.</p>
<p><em>P4 - Oracy Programme<br /></em>The Primary 4 pupils are introduced to debating and public-speaking skills in the course of the enrichment programme. During each session, they undergo training, engage in meaningful activities, work collaboratively and eventually showcase their learning through different platforms such as external competitions. These sessions ultimately develop them into confident and articulate communicators.</p>
