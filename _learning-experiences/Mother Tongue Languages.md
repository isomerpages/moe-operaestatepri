<h4>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</h4>
<p>EXPERIENCES</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Language Week</span><br /></strong>This programme is held in collaboration with the English Department. It aims to enhance the joy of reading and language learning in pupils through a variety of activities that are organised during the week. This year, choice board reading activities were designed for lower/middle/upper primary levels. Pupils submitted their completed entries via ClassDojo. There was also a book mark design competition. Pupils had fun reading their favourite books and the activities were well-received by pupils.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight</u></strong></p>
<p>In view of safe management measures, MTL Fortnight was carried out online last year. Information on selected aspects of the Chinese/Malay/Tamil cultures was shared with pupils as part of the cultural stories package that was rolled out via Student Learning Space (SLS) by levels. Thereafter, pupils had the opportunity to be engaged in the making of different traditional crafts. Through these activities, pupils gained a deeper appreciation of their culture, history and values. Pupils also showcased their language talents in poetry recitation, storytelling, singing etc and uploaded their performance clips via Padlet on the school website.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CL)/Theatre Experience (ML)<br /></u></strong>Pupils are provided with the opportunity to be exposed to language-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing arts groups. In view of the situation this year, pupils were not able to watch the performances live at the theatre. The experience was brought into the classrooms as pupils watched the performances live via Zoom. Nevertheless, pupils enjoyed the performances.</p>

<p><strong><u>Authentic Learning Experiences (Lower Primary)<br /></u></strong>Authentic learning experiences are created within the curriculum to bring classroom teaching alive. For example, CL pupils take on the role of stallholders and customers when purchasing items. Pupils enjoyed the experience while learning the sentence structures for the lesson. Pupils also had the opportunity to have a picnic in class. They learnt vocabulary related to the theme as they ate the food they brought to class. ML pupils learnt the skill of journal writing through the unit &ldquo;We are Active Learners&rdquo;. Pupils learnt about animal folklore through storytelling and experienced paper weaving before writing about their experiences. Drama-based teaching methods are employed in the TL classroom. By taking on different roles in an imaginary setting, pupils are empowered to engage in creative conversations with their peers. The enthusiasm shown by pupils during these lessons brings out the joy of learning.</p>
