<p>EXPERIENCES</p>
<p><strong><u>Language Week</u><br /></strong>This programme is held in collaboration with the English Department. It aims to enhance the joy of reading and language learning in pupils through a variety of activities that are organised during the week. This year, choice board reading activities were designed for lower/middle/upper primary levels. Pupils submitted their completed entries via ClassDojo. There was also a book mark design competition. Pupils had fun reading their favourite books and the activities were well-received by pupils.</p>
