<h4><strong>CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK</strong></h4>
<p>The central focus of Mathematics is mathematical&nbsp;<strong>problem solving</strong>. The framework sets the direction for and provides guidance in the teaching, learning and assessment of mathematics in our school.</p>

<h4><strong>CONCRETE-PICTORIAL-ABSTRACT (C-P-A) APPROACH</strong></h4>
<p>In the teaching and learning of mathematics, our school believes in building a strong foundation in the mathematical concepts in our students. Our students acquire mathematical concepts and skills using the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach. Students are given concrete experiences to help them develop their numeracy skills, make connections and subsequently become better problem-solvers.</p>

<h4><strong>KEY DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><u><strong>LEARNING EXPERIENCES<br></strong></u>Our students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences where they can apply and relate their knowledge of Mathematical skills and concepts to real-life experiences.</p>
<p><strong><em>1) Mathematics all around us: OPERA SUPERMARKET SHOPPING DAY</em><br><br>OPERA SUPERMARKET<br></strong>Students enjoy a shopping trip at the ‘Opera Supermarket’ where they use play money to buy items of their choice. They apply the concepts of addition and subtraction of money in this learning experience.</p>

<p> Our P3 students shopped at OPERA Supermarket for a class party where they used cash and vouchers to buy items within their budget. Students learnt basic financial literacy skills such as budgeting and maximizing the value of vouchers through the incorporation of ‘CDC’ vouchers in their shopping.<br>
   
To extend our students’ learning in this authentic learning experience, they designed an invitation card for their class party. Students learnt the language skills of writing an invitation, which will inform and entice their target audience. This writing activity was done in collaboration with the English Department.

<p><strong><em> 4. LEARNING MATHEMATICS WITH ICT</em><br></strong>Students engage in learning experiences that incorporate the use of technology to allow them to demonstrate their understanding of the Mathematical concepts.</p>

Our P6 students had the opportunity to apply the Mathematical knowledge they learnt in the classroom to the real-life situation of making a kite. Flying their kites was truly seeing how Mathematics came alive!</p>

<h4>SUPPORT PROGRAMMES</h4>
<p>Early intervention programmes are provided to help support identified pupils address misconceptions, consolidate and reinforce their learning as well as build their confidence in the learning of Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. LEARNING SUPPORT FOR MATHEMATICS (LSM)&nbsp;PROGRAMME&nbsp;(P1- P3)</em><br></strong>The LSM programme aims to provide early intervention support in Mathematics to students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills at the lower primary levels.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. IMPROVING CONFIDENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT IN NUMERACY (ICAN)&nbsp;PROGRAMME</em></strong><br>For the middle primary levels, the&nbsp;<strong>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN</strong><strong>)&nbsp;</strong>programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support low progress learners using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. REMEDIATION&nbsp;PROGRAMME&nbsp;(P4 – P6)</em></strong><em><br>The after-school mathematics remediation programme aims to help identify pupils who need additional support, reinforce and consolidate their learning so that they build and strengthen their foundation.</em></p><em><br>
<h4><strong>EXTENSION PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p>In line with the school’s continual emphasis on enriching and developing students’ potential to their fullest, P5 and P6 students are identified to undergo Olympiad training programme to be equipped with the necessary Mathematical knowledge and repertoire of problem-solving and visual-thinking skills to solve higher-order and non-routine problems. Some of these competitions these students take part in include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS)</li>
<li>National Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (NMOS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>1. E2K MATHEMATICS&nbsp;PROGRAMME&nbsp;(P4 and P5)<br></em></strong><em>In this programme, selected P4 and P5 students will have the opportunity to develop their critical and analytical thinking as well as their problem solving skills through an inquiry approach. Students also develop 21st century competencies such as effective communication as they collaborate with their peers to work on puzzles, games and mathematical explorations that are specially designed for this programmme.</em></p><em>
<p><strong><em>2. MATHEMATICS COMPETITIONS<br></em></strong><em>Our pupils have the opportunity to participate in competitions to further extend their learning of mathematics beyond the classroom. Some of these competitions include the Primary Mathematics Project Competition (PMPC) and the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS).</em></p><em>
