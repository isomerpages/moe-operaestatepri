<h4><strong>CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/Science/frame.jpg">

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">The school’s Science Curriculum is guided by the MOE Science Curriculum Framework. Our students are diverse, with different needs, interests, and aptitudes for Science. The curriculum design seeks to enable our students to view the pursuit of Science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus guided by knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment.</p>
	
	
<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">Our Science Education aims to:<br><br>- enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, enabling them to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives.<br>
<br>-provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.</p>

<h4><b>   The 3 "IN"s Surrounding the Science Experience in OEPS</b></h4>

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">   

1. <b>Inspire</b> – Spark curiosity and wonder about the natural world.

2. <b>Inquire</b> – Foster a spirit of exploration through questioning, investigating, and evidence-based reasoning.

3. <b>Innovate</b> – Encourage creativity and application of scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>

<h4><b>SCIENCE PROGRAMMES</b></h4>

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">   
Our Science programmes are structured to provide opportunities for our students to explore, investigate and discover knowledge. We want our students to be curious and concerned about their surroundings. We seek to fuel this spirit of inquiry and ultimately want our students to enjoy Science and value this discipline as an important tool in understanding and relating to their natural and physical world.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><u><b>P3 Grow a Seed</b></u><br>
   
<img style="width: 30%;" src="/images/Science/seed.jpg"><br>
• Our Primary 3 students had a wonderful time deepening their understanding of plants through a hands-on activity—<b>growing their very own seed!</b> As part of the "Every Child a Seed" programme by NParks, each student received a plant starter kit to kickstart their planting journey.

• This meaningful experience allowed students to not only learn about the plant life cycle, but also to <b>appreciate the patience, care, and effort</b> required in nurturing a living thing. From planting the seeds to watching the first sprouts emerge, students experienced the challenges and the joy of growing a plant.

• It was a valuable opportunity to connect Science learning with real-life experiences —fostering responsibility, curiosity, and a deeper appreciation for nature.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><u><b>P3 Grow a Mealworm Beetle</b></u><br>   

<img style="width: 10 0%;" src="/images/Science/worm.jpg"><br>
• Our Primary 3 students had a hands-on opportunity to explore the topic of <b>Life Cycles of Animals</b> by growing their very own mealworm beetles. Throughout this learning experience, students observed the complete metamorphosis of the mealworm—from <b>larva to pupa, and finally to adult beetle.</b>

• They were excited to witness each stage up close, with many expressing amazement at the transformation process. This real-life observation deepened their understanding of life cycles and sparked meaningful conversations with their peers as they shared their observations and discoveries.

• It was a fun and engaging way to nurture curiosity and bring Science learning to life!

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><u><b>P4 Biodiversity Learning Journey to Botanic Garden</b></u><br><br>   
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/Science/bio1.jpg"><br>• Students explored the Singapore Botanic Gardens and experienced learning in nature! During the journey, they discovered how plants are classified and studied different plant parts and their functions. They compared flowering and non-flowering plants, and observed mosses, ferns, fungi, and water plants up close.<br><br><img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/Science/bio2.jpg"><br>• Through hands-on exploration, students also examined different types of leaves and applied what they had learnt in class in a real-life setting. This immersive experience strengthened their understanding of the natural world and developed their observation and classification skills.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><u><b>P6 Learning Journey to Science Centre: Energy Lab Workshop</b></u><br>   

• Our Primary 6 students visited the Science Centre for an exciting Energy Lab workshop. Through hands-on activities, they explored different forms of energy and discovered how most energy sources originate from the sun.
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/Science/lab1.jpg">

• Students worked in teams to build marble machines, demonstrating how energy converts from one form to another — such as potential energy changing into kinetic energy. The experience not only deepened their understanding of energy concepts but also emphasized the importance of energy conservation in daily life.
