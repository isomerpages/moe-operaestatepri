<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify">The schoolâ€™s Science Curriculum is guided by the MOE Science Curriculum Framework. Our students are diverse, with different needs, interests, and aptitudes for Science. The curriculum design seeks to enable our students to view the pursuit of Science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus guided by knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment.</p>
