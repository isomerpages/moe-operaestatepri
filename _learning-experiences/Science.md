<h4><strong>CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 50%;" src="/images/sci1.png" />
<p>The school&rsquo;s Science Curriculum is guided by the MOE Science Curriculum Framework. Central to the Framework is the conduct of inquiry, founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills &amp; Processes and (c) Ethics &amp; Attitudes. The curriculum design seeks to enable pupils to view the pursuit of Science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus guided by knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment.</p>
<h4><strong>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p>Our Science programmes are structured to provide opportunities for our pupils to explore, investigate and discover knowledge. We want our pupils to be curious and concerned about their surroundings. We seek to fuel this spirit of inquiry and ultimately want our pupils to enjoy Science and value this discipline as an important tool in understanding and relating to their natural and physical world.</p>

<div>
<p>Our P3 pupils had a great time learning more about plants by getting hands-on experience in growing a seed. Every student is given a plant starter kit provided by NParks &ndash; Every Child a Seed programme. This programme gives students a chance to go through and appreciate the challenges of the planting process, and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow.</p>

<p><strong><u>P3 Boat-Making(Authentic Learning)</u></strong></p>
<p>For the topic on Diversity of Materials, the P3 students learnt about different types of materials and their uses via SLS lesson packages. Students were then tasked to make a boat from recycled materials and submit a video of the boat floating successfully on water. Through this authentic learning experience, students were able to apply their understanding of the properties of materials and honed their creativity and resourcefulness.</p>

<div>
<p>Our P4 pupils had an opportunity to grow butterflies / mealworm beetles which is aligned to the topic on Life Cycles of Animals. They enjoyed the process of watching the growth of the insect at its different stages and were able to share their experiences with their peers. Pupils related that their curiosity was piqued when they saw first-hand how the larva changed into a pupa before finally emerging as an adult butterfly / mealworm beetle.</p>

<div>
<p>Our P4 pupils had a great time planting various types of plants in the school&rsquo;s Science garden. To extend and excite them in the learning of the P4 topic &lsquo;Life Cycle of Plants&rsquo;, pupils were tasked to chart the growth of the plants over a period of time and observe the different stages of plant growth. The pupils received&nbsp; the fruits of labour at the end of the activity!</p>

<div>
<p>Using a micro:bit, P4 students learnt coding and computational thinking. The students then went through the Design Thinking process and collaborated to create a prototype which aims to address a real-life problem related to Environmental Sustainability &ndash; the excessive consumption of electricity.</p>
<p>The groups presented their prototypes in class and the top two winning groups from each class had the opportunity of sharing with the rest of the cohort via Zoom. Voting was then conducted to identify the top two groups of the level with the most innovative and relevant prototype.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students learnt how to problem solve and apply their knowledge critically and creatively. They also learnt how to collaborate as a team and demonstrated their communication and presentation skills.</p>

<div>
<p>Our P5 pupils went for the DNA Basics workshop at Science Centre as part of the learning experience for the topic, &lsquo;Unit of Life&rsquo;. They learnt about the structure of DNA and its importance, and had an opportunity to extract DNA from a bacteria cell. Through the extraction, they were able to view the DNA in a test tube! Pupils also constructed a model of the DNA double-helix structure which they could bring home.</p>

<div>
<p>As part of the OEPS Science learning experiences, the Primary 6 students had the opportunity to attend the &ldquo;Blast-Off!&rdquo; workshop organised by Singapore Science Centre. Educators from Singapore Science Centre taught the pupils about the physics behind rocket science by relating it to the topic on Forces that they have learnt.</p>
<p>The pupils were then guided on how to design a rocket that can fly far and high. Through the engaging activity of building their own mini rocket using commonly available materials, our pupils had the chance to apply Science concepts and had fun cheering each other on during the rocket launches!</p>

<p><strong>EXTENSION</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>P4 &amp; P5 E2K Programme<br /></u></strong>Selected P4 and P5 pupils were given opportunities to engage in scientific investigations involving advanced science concepts. The E2K sessions enabled pupils to engage in scientific inquiry that helped them develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess as well as to gain 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills. The different experiments exposed them to various science apparatus. Working in teams allowed pupils to overcome challenges when they encountered problems in their experiments too.</p>

<p><strong><u>P5 Singapore Primary Science Olympiad<br /></u></strong>9 students participated in the annual Science Olympiad organised by NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. The competition aims to cultivate interest and provide an avenue for students to showcase their abilities in Science. We are happy to share that 2 students were awarded the Bronze award in 2019!</p>
