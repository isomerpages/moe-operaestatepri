<p><strong>OPERA ESTATE PRIMARY SCHOOL&nbsp;</strong>was founded in 1985 with the amalgamation of Opera Estate Boys&rsquo; Primary School and Opera Estate Girls&rsquo; Primary School. It is a government co-educational school located in a private housing estate. The school was at a holding site along New Upper Changi Road for two and a half years before moving back to its former site at Fidelio Street in June 2003 after the completion of PRIME. The school held its 20th Anniversary cum Re-Opening Ceremony on 11 March 2005. Currently it operates as a single session school.</p>
<p>In 2014, the school was granted the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) in the area of Aesthetics to provide greater opportunities for students to develop a deeper appreciation of the Arts and Music and cultivate values such as understanding and appreciating the works of fellow schoolmates, patience and responsibility. The LLP also helps students to provide a broader outlook in choosing their education path.</p>
<p>The school engages parents actively in delivering its school goals. It has officially set up the Opera Parents&rsquo; Club (OPC) to be the link between the school and parents. The OPC comprising parent volunteers supports the school in different activities. These include recess time indoor play, school excursion supervision and co-organising events such as international friendship day, festive celebrations.The school has created an environment that is conducive for promoting National Education (NE) and has received the NE Development Award in 2005, recognising its effort to expose pupils to the history and traditions of Singapore.</p>
