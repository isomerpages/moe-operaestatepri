<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p><strong>Greetings to you !</strong></p>
<p>I am humbled to join the Opera Estate Primary School community, which has a rich history and heritage. Since its establishment in 1985 as a merger between Opera Boys&rsquo; School and Opera Girls&rsquo; School, OEPS has grown from strength to strength, establishing itself as a Happy, Loving, Learning School.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the care and support from our dedicated teaching and non-teaching staff, our partners, including the School Advisory Committee members, Opera Parents Club, community partners, and our supportive parents.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 situation has impacted the way we live, work, study and play, The way we learn and collaborate in school is continuously evolving amidst the changing landscape. To thrive in today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, &ldquo;Learn for Life&rdquo; and the 21st Century Competencies become even more important.</p>
<p>Our school will continue to provide quality and authentic learning experiences for our students to develop the 21st Century Competencies. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) &ldquo;Ignite D&rsquo; Arts@OEPS&rdquo; provides opportunities for students to have a deeper appreciation of the Arts and develop the care for the community and confidence in articulating one&rsquo;s expression for the Arts. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) &ldquo;Opera Goes Green&rdquo; seeks to instill in our students the importance of responsible actions towards environmental care and sustainability and to take actions through critical thinking and innovating practical solutions to advocate a more sustainable way of life within and beyond the school. Besides the 21CC, the ALP aims to inculcate values such as empathy and responsibility to maintain their own wellbeing and that of the larger community in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>At OEPS, we place strong emphasis on developing students of good character and active citizens. Through our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) structure, implementation of PERMAH (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, Health) and AOG (Attitude of Gratitude) programme, we aim to instill in our students the importance of empathy and to promote emotional well-being.</p>
<p>I look forward to partnering with our SAC, members of the Opera Parents Club and community partners to provide our students with a quality school experience that is &ldquo;Uniquely Opera&rdquo; and to pave the way for the next phase of growth for OEPS. Together, we will continue to nurture our students to become lifelong learners who are confident, compassionate, and responsible members of society.</p>
<p>Your Partner-In-Education,<br /><strong>Mrs Tan Wai Ling<br /></strong>Principal</p>
