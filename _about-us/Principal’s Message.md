<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p><strong>Greetings to you !</strong></p>
<p>I am truly humbled to be given the opportunity to join Opera Estate Primary School, a school with rich history and heritage. Established in 1985, OEPS has grown from strength to strength under the able leadership of the Principals before. I had the opportunity to interact with the teachers and students the last two months and experienced the strong culture of care in OEPS that many spoke of.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 situation in the last two years have impacted the way we live, work, study and play. Despite this, the students and staff have shown resilience and adaptability in the face of these changes. Our team of dedicated staff and key personnel worked tirelessly to ensure learning continued seamlessly. The way we learn and collaborate in school is also continuously evolving amidst the changing landscape. To thrive in today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, &ldquo;Learn for Life&rdquo; and the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century Competencies become all the more important.</p>
<p>Our school will continue to provide quality and authentic learning experiences for our students to develop the 21CCs. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) &ldquo;Ignite D&rsquo; Arts@OEPS&rdquo; provide opportunities for students to have a deeper appreciation for the Arts and develop the care for community and confidence in articulating one&rsquo;s expression for the Arts. Attained recently in end 2021, the school&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) &ldquo;Opera Goes Green&rdquo; seeks to instill in our students the importance of responsible actions towards environmental care and sustainability and to take actions through critical thinking and innovating practical solutions to advocate a more sustainable way of life within and beyond the school. Besides the 21CC, the ALP aims to inculcate values such as empathy and responsibility to maintain their own wellbeing and that of the larger community in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Our school will also continue to place strong emphasis to develop students of good character and active citizens. Through our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) structure, implementation of PERMAH (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, Health) and AOG (Attitude of Gratitude) programme, we aim to&nbsp;instill&nbsp;in our students the importance of empathy and to promote emotional well-being.</p>
<p>I look forward to partnering with our SAC, members of the Opera Parents Club and community partners to provide our students with a quality school experience that is &ldquo;Uniquely Opera&rdquo; and to pave the way for the next phase of growth for OEPS.</p>
<p>Your Partner-In-Education,<br /><strong>Mrs Tan Wai Ling<br /></strong>Principal</p>
