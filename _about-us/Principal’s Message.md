<p style="font-size:18px;" align="justify"><b>Vision, Mission and Values</b></p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">Since end 2022, we have embarked on a series of conversations with our various stakeholders on their aspirations for the next phase of growth for OEPS. This year, in 2024, we are excited to share with you our new Vision, Mission and Values.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">Our new Vision <b>“Confident Learners, Caring Contributors”</b> is a clear representation of our dedication to nurture our students to be creative, self-directed and be committed to contribute for the betterment of the community and the environment. We want to inculcate in our students a sense of gratitude, develop the confidence to embrace changes and instill in them a genuine desire to make a positive impact. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">Our school will also continue to place strong emphasis to develop students of good character and active citizens. Through our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) structure, implementation of PERMAH (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, Health) and AOG (Attitude of Gratitude) programme, we aim to instill in our students the importance of empathy and to promote emotional well-being.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">We value every child as a unique individual who wants to and can learn. Every child is thus a Gem that can be and will be polished through the holistic experiences in OEPS. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">Our new Mission <b>“To empower every OPERA Gem to drive meaningful impact and be ready for the future”</b> is a continual emphasis on our dedication to provide a holistic education that equips students with the skills, knowledge and values necessary to thrive in an ever-changing world. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px:" align="justify">Values form the core of one’s character. Our new school values are presented in the acronym “<b>R2IGHT</b>” which stands for “<b><u>R</u></b>espect, <b><u>R</u></b>esponsibility, <b><u>I</u></b>ntegrity, <b><u>G</u></b>ratitude, <b><u>H</u></b>umility and <b><u>T</u></b>enacity”. We aim to create opportunities to learn and meaningfully apply these values to form a strong sense of identity and to make good choices within various contexts.
