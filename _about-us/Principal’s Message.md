<p align="justify">Welcome to Opera Estate Primary School!  
Opera Estate Primary School (OEPS) is an amalgamation of Opera Boys’ School and Opera Girls’ School in 1985. Since then, OEPS has grown from strength to strength to establish herself as a Happy, Loving, Learning School.</p>

<p align="justify">**Vision, Mission and Values**</p>

<p align="justify">Our Vision&nbsp;**“Confident Learners, Caring Contributors”**&nbsp;is a clear representation of our dedication to foster a supportive and vibrant learning environment where students grow as Effective Communicators, Self-directed learners, Creative and Critical Thinkers, and Civic-Minded Rooted citizens. We want to inculcate in our students a sense of gratitude, develop the confidence to embrace changes and instill in them a genuine desire to make a positive impact.</p>

<p align="justify">Our school places strong emphasis to develop students of good character and active citizens. Through our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) structure, implementation of PERMAH (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, Health) and AOG (Attitude of Gratitude) programme, we aim to instill in our students the importance of empathy and to promote emotional well-being.</p>

<p align="justify">We value every child as a unique individual who wants to and can learn. Every child is thus a Gem that can be and will be polished through the holistic experiences in OEPS.</p>

<p align="justify">Our Mission&nbsp;**“To empower every OPERA Gem to drive meaningful impact and be ready for the future”**&nbsp;is a continual emphasis on our dedication to provide a holistic education that equips students with the skills, knowledge and values necessary to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p align="justify">Values form the core of one’s character. Our new school values are presented in the acronym “**R2IGHT**” which stands for “**R**espect,&nbsp;**R**esponsibility,&nbsp;**I**ntegrity,&nbsp;**G**ratitude,&nbsp;**H**umility and&nbsp;**T**enacity”. We aim to create opportunities to learn and meaningfully apply these values to form a strong sense of identity and to make good choices within various contexts.</p>

<p align="justify">Our school will continue to provide quality and authentic learning experiences for our students to develop the emerging 21CCs. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) “Ignite D’ Arts@OEPS” provide opportunities for students to have a deeper appreciation for the Arts and develop the confidence in articulating one’s expression for the Arts. The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) “Opera Goes Green” seeks to instill in our students the importance of responsible actions towards environmental care and sustainability and to take actions through critical thinking and innovating practical solutions to advocate a more sustainable way of life within and beyond the school. Besides the 21CC, the ALP aims to inculcate values such as empathy and responsibility to maintain their own wellbeing and that of the larger community in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

<p align="justify">This year is particularly significant as we mark our 40th year with the theme “**Celebrating our Past, Shaping our Future**.” As we reflect on how far we have we have come as a school, we remain focused on the present and aspire towards the future. We continue to refine our approaches to education and ensure that every child receives the support and opportunities they need to reach their fullest potential.</p>

<p align="justify">I look forward to partnering our parents, School Advisory Committee, members of the Opera Parents Club and community partners to provide our students with a quality school experience and nurture our students to be future-ready, lifelong learners.</p>
