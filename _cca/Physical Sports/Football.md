<h4><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h4>
<p>The OEPS Football Team was formed in 2011 and has since grown from strength to strength. With a talented group of pupils, we have performed well in many competitions year after year, each time putting up a strong challenge. In 2012, OEPS Football grew to include a development team that allowed for more boys to join in the training to learn basic football skills. The development team was also used as a platform to promote players who have shown great improvement. Every year, we successfully promote a handful of players to join the school team.</p>
<h4><strong>OUR OBJECTIVES</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To provide an avenue for pupils to display sportsmanship behaviour as competitors and non-competitors</li>
