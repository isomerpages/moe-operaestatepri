<h4><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 43%;" src="/images/ed2.jpeg" align = "right" />
<p>The OEPS English Drama was created to cultivate the love for performing arts through experience and involvement in drama. During the sessions, our pupils receive training in Drama techniques, engage in small group activities like script-writing and eventually put together an annual performance to showcase their learning.</p>
