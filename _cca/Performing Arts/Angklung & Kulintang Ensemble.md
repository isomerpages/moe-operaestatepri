<p>The Opera Estate Primary Angklung/Kulintang Ensemble is made up of students of all races coming together to express themselves through the melodious music of the angklung and kulintang. It aims to create a fun environment where our members can come together to develop their passion for the arts and qualities of musicianship. Our repertoire often includes traditional folk songs, local songs and popular songs. As a Performing Arts Group, the OEPS Angklung/Kulintang Ensemble aims to instil continuous learning, teamwork, discipline and resilience in our pupils as they work with one another to perfect their harmonious performances.</p>
