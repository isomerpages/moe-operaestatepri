<h4><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:120%;" align="justify">The Robotics Club members attend weekly sessions that are designed to develop their programming skills progressively. During the CCA sessions, pupils work in teams to develop their robots and programming skills through accomplishing the challenges and missions assigned to them. Beyond honing their skills in Robotics, pupils also learn other invaluable skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and resilience as they work on their challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>OUR OBJECTIVES</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li align="justify">To foster creativity and problem-solving skills in our pupils as they work together in a team to solve challenges.</li>
<li align="justify">To provide a platform for pupils to apply their programming skills and logical thinking to create solutions to solve Robotic missions.</li>
</ol>
