<h4><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h4>
<p>   

Green Club is an essential part of our school's ALP Opera Goes Green initiative. In line with Singapore's Green Plan and the Ministry of Education's Eco Stewardship Programme, the CCA aims to establish a platform for a committed group of students who are enthusiastic about promoting environmental sustainability.

Green Club will concentrate on three main themes: conservation of resources, keeping Singapore clean, and biodiversity. We aim to promote both appreciation and protection of the natural environment that surrounds us. Experiential learning is at the core of our club's activities, which includes role-playing, reflection, donation drives, upcycling activities, VIA for reducing food waste and learning journeys. This hands-on approach to learning will help members to better understand the importance of environmental sustainability. We believe that with our club's efforts and the collective efforts of others, we can make a significant difference in promoting environmental sustainability.</p>
