<h4><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h4>
<p>The objective of our CCA is to provide the pupils with an opportunity to learn basic track &amp; field skills as well as enable pupils to develop their motor skills in a fun and safety manner. Under the guidance of the coach, the pupils learn to run, hop, throw and jump in activities suitable to their age and well-being.</p>
<p>Pupils will have the opportunity to compete participate in the national competition, which has been revamped recently to suit the pupils&rsquo; needs.</p>
<h4><strong>OUR OBJECTIVES</strong></h4>
<p>Track and Field CCA is a platform for pupils to learn the basic fundamentals of Track &amp; Field as well as valuable life skills such as perseverance, working hard, not being afraid to fail, being a good team-mate and setting achievable goals. Winning medals is not the focus of our CCA but rather, the journey of giving your best, doing your best and achieving your best.</p>

This year marks the beginning of the new format for the Junior Division whereby the emphasis is more on pupils performing multiple skills that caters to children their age instead of the traditional Track &amp; Field events. Our Athletics Development pupils were given the opportunity to represent the school in the events of this new format while our Athletics School team members continued to participate in the traditional events.</p></td>
