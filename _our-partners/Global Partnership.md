<h4><strong>Anuban Krabi School</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Hosting Anuban Krabi Elementary School<br /></strong>OEPS has been hosting Anuban Krabi Elementary School every year since 2017. This collaboration gives&nbsp;both sets of students as well as educators to learn more about each other&rsquo;s cultures through interaction&nbsp;and art making activities. Our P6 pupil leaders take the lead in welcoming our friends from Krabi as well&nbsp;as making art pieces together in groups, mingling and getting to know each other better, and guiding&nbsp;them in a school tour.</p>

<h4><strong>Japan Airline (JAL)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Collaboration with JAL - P3 Origami Programme<br /></strong>OEPS partners with Japan Airlines to conduct a paper plane origami programme for all P3 pupils. This programme introduces the pupils to the art of origami. They learn to fold paper aeroplanes, guided by staff from JAL. Pupils also learn about Japanese culture through this activity. In 2019, we were honoured to have Mr Takuo Toda (President of Origami Paper Plane Association Japan and Guinness World Record Holder for longest flying aircraft) to grace the event.</p>
