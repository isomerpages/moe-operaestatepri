<p>The&nbsp;<strong>School Advisory Committee (SAC)</strong>&nbsp;is made up of members from the business, social and community sectors. They play an active role in promoting excellence in school by providing advice on the strategic directions of the school based on their expertise, experience and diverse perspective. The committee also provides financial assistance to students who are in times of need.</p>
<p>Since 2019, the SAC has instituted awards to recognise graduating students with exemplary character and excellence contributions in the areas of leadership, sports and arts. In 2020, more recognition was extended to our students. The inaugural SAC Education Awards was represented to P3 to P5 students who have shown grit and resilience in their academic pursuit.</p>
