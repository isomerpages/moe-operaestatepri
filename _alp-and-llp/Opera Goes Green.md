<h4>World Water Day</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">

• On World Water Day, students learn about the vital role water plays in our lives through a variety of activities and games led by our Green Champs. They explore ways to use water wisely, like turning off taps, taking shorter showers, and preventing waste.

• In addition, the Green Champions shared information about Earth Hour, and the school participated by turning off all lights and fans to conserve energy.

• By spreading these ideas to their friends and families, students can help protect the planet. It’s a day dedicated to learning, taking action, and making a positive impact on the Earth!</p>
