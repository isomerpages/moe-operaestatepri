<h4>World Water Day</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">• On World Water Day, students learn about the vital role water plays in our lives through a variety of activities and games led by our Green Champs. They explore ways to use water wisely, like turning off taps, taking shorter showers, and preventing waste.<br><br>• In addition, the Green Champions shared information about Earth Hour, and the school participated by turning off all lights and fans to conserve energy.<br><br>• By spreading these ideas to their friends and families, students can help protect the planet. It’s a day dedicated to learning, taking action, and making a positive impact on the Earth!</p><br>

<h4>   Less Food Waste - COMPOST VIA</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">Our Green Champions continue to be at the forefront of environmental advocacy in our school community. This year, they led the annual food recycling assembly, encouraging their peers to reduce food waste and make use of the composting machine in the school canteen. To support this initiative, the Green Champions are rostered during recess to guide students in properly sorting their food waste, reinforcing daily habits of sustainability.<br><br>In a further step towards a zero-waste campus, a second composting machine has been installed in the staff pantry, enabling staff to participate in our food recycling efforts. The compost produced from both machines is used to nourish the school garden, closing the loop and turning waste into a valuable resource.<br><br>Beyond the school grounds, our Green Champions have extended their efforts into the community. For the fourth consecutive year, they organised a compost distribution drive for residents living near the school. During the drive, students shared practical tips on reducing food waste and successfully distributed bags of compost to interested residents, fostering greater awareness and participation in sustainable practices.<br><br>Through these initiatives, our Green Champions continue to inspire both peers and the wider community to take meaningful steps toward environmental stewardship.</p><br>

<h4>Less E-Waste-Recycling Drive</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify"><br>• The school collaborated with ALBA and held an e-waste recycling drive. The initiative aimed to promote Environmental Sustainability by encouraging responsible e-waste disposal within the school and the broader community.<br><br>• To maximise outreach, information about the drive was shared with staff, students, parents, and nearby residents through multiple communication channels. Posters were prominently displayed both within the school compound and in surrounding areas, raising awareness and inviting participation from the community.<br><br>• Our Green Champions led a 15-minute assembly talk to educate the school on the importance of e-waste recycling. With the engaging theme ‘Turning Trash to Treasure’, they inspired their peers to think critically about the impact of electronic waste and the value of recycling.<br><br>• This ongoing effort reflects our commitment to sustainability and our shared responsibility to care for the environment.</p>
