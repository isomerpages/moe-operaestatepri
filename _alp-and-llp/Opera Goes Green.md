<h4>World Water Day</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">• On World Water Day, students learn about the vital role water plays in our lives through a variety of activities and games led by our Green Champs. They explore ways to use water wisely, like turning off taps, taking shorter showers, and preventing waste.<br><br>• In addition, the Green Champions shared information about Earth Hour, and the school participated by turning off all lights and fans to conserve energy.<br><br>• By spreading these ideas to their friends and families, students can help protect the planet. It’s a day dedicated to learning, taking action, and making a positive impact on the Earth!</p><br>

<h4>   Less Food Waste - COMPOST VIA</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">Our Green Champions continue to be at the forefront of environmental advocacy in our school community. This year, they led the annual food recycling assembly, encouraging their peers to reduce food waste and make use of the composting machine in the school canteen. To support this initiative, the Green Champions are rostered during recess to guide students in properly sorting their food waste, reinforcing daily habits of sustainability.<br><br>In a further step towards a zero-waste campus, a second composting machine has been installed in the staff pantry, enabling staff to participate in our food recycling efforts. The compost produced from both machines is used to nourish the school garden, closing the loop and turning waste into a valuable resource.<br><br>Beyond the school grounds, our Green Champions have extended their efforts into the community. For the fourth consecutive year, they organised a compost distribution drive for residents living near the school. During the drive, students shared practical tips on reducing food waste and successfully distributed bags of compost to interested residents, fostering greater awareness and participation in sustainable practices.<br><br>Through these initiatives, our Green Champions continue to inspire both peers and the wider community to take meaningful steps toward environmental stewardship.</p><br>

<h4>Less E-Waste-Recycling Drive</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">• The school collaborated with ALBA and held an e-waste recycling drive. The initiative aimed to promote Environmental Sustainability by encouraging responsible e-waste disposal within the school and the broader community.<br><br>• To maximise outreach, information about the drive was shared with staff, students, parents, and nearby residents through multiple communication channels. Posters were prominently displayed both within the school compound and in surrounding areas, raising awareness and inviting participation from the community.<br><br>• Our Green Champions led a 15-minute assembly talk to educate the school on the importance of e-waste recycling. With the engaging theme ‘Turning Trash to Treasure’, they inspired their peers to think critically about the impact of electronic waste and the value of recycling.<br><br>• This ongoing effort reflects our commitment to sustainability and our shared responsibility to care for the environment.</p><br>

<h4>Biodiversity Day @ OEPS</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">Singapore’s diverse wildlife continues to thrive even within our urban landscape. To raise awareness and inspire action, OEPS commemorated Biodiversity Day with a series of impactful school-wide and community activities focused on marine conservation.<br><br>Our students took action both in and out of school!<br><br>Within the school, a plastic recycling drive helped students learn to identify recyclables and reduce plastic waste, especially common items from their recess such as jelly containers and plastic bottles. Through hands-on sorting activities during recess, students developed a deeper understanding of the waste polluting our oceans.<br><br>Adding creativity to conservation, a special booth showcased the Primary 3 Marine Life Art Exhibit, where students displayed beautiful sculptures made entirely from recycled materials. These artworks served as a reminder that even waste can be transformed into something meaningful.<br><br>Taking their stewardship to the community, a group of students headed to East Coast Park for a beach clean-up. The experience was eye-opening. Many students were surprised by the amount of litter found and expressed a strong desire to do more for our environment. It was a powerful moment of reflection and action that left a lasting impression on all who took part.<br><br>Our students truly embodied what it means to be eco stewards, taking real steps to care for our environment and protect marine life for future generations.</p><br>

<h4>Plastic Recycling Drive</h4>

<p style="font-size:18px" align="justify">The school launched a plastic recycling drive in support of Biodiversity Day, which focused on the importance of marine life conservation and the detrimental effects of plastic pollution on these efforts.<br><br>In collaboration with Sembcorp, students were equipped with the knowledge and resources to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable plastics. They also learned how to properly sort recyclable plastics for collection. Students actively contributed by bringing in plastic waste from home or recycling plastics used in school, placing them in the designated recycling corner located in the school canteen.<br><br>Through a series of assembly talks and recycling initiatives, both students and staff have become more conscious of their consumption habits and the environmental impact of plastic waste. These efforts have successfully raised awareness and encouraged more mindful choices in purchasing and usage of materials.<br><br>The recycling drive also strengthened home-school partnerships, as it required the active involvement of parents. This initiative created meaningful opportunities for families and school staff to collaborate toward a shared goal of environmental sustainability.</p><br>
